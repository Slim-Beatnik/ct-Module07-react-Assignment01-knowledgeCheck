    <h1>Welcome to the quiz creation and play</h1>
            <p>
                This is a simple React application.
                <br/>
                The purpose of this application is to create and play quiz games using the Open Trivia Database API.
                <br/>
                We hope you have fun!
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Quiz Master, enter your name and we'll give you a key.</li>
                <li>Choose a category, difficulty, and amount. There are limits; we'll let you know.
                    <br/>If you choose more than one category or over 50 questions, it will take an additional 5 seconds to complete the data fetch
                </li>
                <li>You'll be able to create your teams while the timer counts down.
                    <br/>Multiple teams can chose the same team token, but the colors will be the unique identifier along with a name.
                    <br/>Make certain to set the order of your inputs based on the order in which you'd like to play.
                </li>
                <li>Your quiz will begin after data is fetched, and teams are chosen.
                    <ol style={ listStyleType: lowerAlpha }>
                    <li>Quiz Master, you're in charge of the previous question, next question, and submit button, so that you remain in control of rules we haven't thought about.</li>
                    <li>The Quiz Master can play along as each question is verified and randomized by this site.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Your score will be displayed at the end of the quiz.</li>
                <li>You can restart the whole process, or part of the process at this point.</li>
            </ol>
